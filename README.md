This project focuses on analyzing customer profiles, geographic data, monthly termination trends, and churn rates within the insurance industry. The dataset consists of several key customer and demographic attributes, geographic details, and termination records. By exploring various dimensions, this analysis aims to provide insights into insurance premium variations, customer behavior, and churn patterns.

## Dataset

This dataset consists of four data files, which are related by linking through either **individual_id** or **address_id**.

You can access the dataset here: [Insurance Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/auto-insurance-churn-analysis-dataset?select=autoinsurance_churn.csv).

1)  **Address Data:** This data file contains address and geographic information and consists of 1,536,673 rows. The variables are:

    -   **address_id**: Unique ID for a specific address.
    -   **latitude**: Latitude of the address.
    -   **longitude**: Longitude of the address.
    -   **street_address**: Mailing address.
    -   **city**: City.
    -   **state**: The state, which is Texas.
    -   **county**: County.

    The primary key of this table/data file is **address_id**.

2)  **Customer Data:** This data file contains customer information and consists of 2,280,320 rows. The variables are:

    -   **individual_id**: Unique ID for a specific insurance customer.
    -   **address_id**: Unique ID for the primary address associated with a customer.
    -   **curr_ann_prem**: The annual dollar amount paid by the customer. This is not the policy amount, but the amount the customer paid during the previous year.
    -   **days_tenure**: The number of days the individual has been a customer with the insurance agency.
    -   **cust_orig_date**: The date the individual became a customer.
    -   **age_in_years**: The age of the individual.
    -   **date_of_birth**: The individualâ€™s date of birth.
    -   **soc_sec_number**: Social Security Number, where the middle two digits are replaced with "XX" to prevent exposure of actual SSNs.

    The primary key of this table/data file is **individual_id**, and the foreign key is **address_id**.

3)  **Demographic Data:** This data file contains demographic information and consists of 2,112,579 rows. The variables are:

    -   **individual_id**: Unique ID for a specific insurance customer.
    -   **income**: Estimated income for the household associated with the individual.
    -   **has_children**: A flag indicating whether the individual has children in the household (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
    -   **length_of_residence**: Estimated number of years the individual has lived in their current residence.
    -   **marital**: Estimated marital status (Married or Single).
    -   **home_market_value**: Estimated value of the home.
    -   **home_owner**: A flag indicating whether the individual owns their primary home (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
    -   **college_degree**: A flag indicating whether the individual has a college degree or higher (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
    -   **good_credit**: A flag indicating whether the individual has a FICO score greater than 630 (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).

    The primary key of this table/data file is **individual_id**.

4)  **Termination Data:** This data file contains account suspension or cancellation information and consists of 269,259 rows. The variables are:

    -   **individual_id**: Unique ID for a specific insurance customer.
    -   **acct_suspd_date**: Day of account suspension or cancellation.

    The primary key of this table/data file is **individual_id**.

## Analysis Overview

1.  **Customer Profile Analysis**:
    -   Analyzes insurance premiums based on age, income, education, and other attributes.
    -   Tracks changes in customer registrations monthly and annually.
2.  **Geographic Insurance Analysis**:
    -   Examines how premiums vary across cities and counties.
    -   Analyzes customer tenure by location and income-premium correlations.
3.  **Monthly Termination Analysis**:
    -   Tracks monthly changes in termination counts and examines customer tenure related to cancellations.
4.  **Churn Analysis**:
    -   Explores churn rates based on tenure, income, education, home ownership, and geography.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into several directories, each serving a specific purpose in the insurance analysis:

-   **analysis**: Contains SQL scripts for various analysis such as customer profiling, churn analysis, and geographical insights.
-   **data_loading_and_keys**: Includes SQL scripts for initial data loading and setup of database tables, ensuring primary and foreign keys are correctly established.
-   **data_quality**: Holds SQL scripts designed to perform data quality checks ensuring the integrity and correctness of the data before it is used in analysis.

Additionally, there are a few more files:

-   **LICENSE**: The license file which outlines the terms under which the project is shared.
-   **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and additional documentation to help understand and navigate the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **SQL**: The project requires SQL for running queries.
-   **Database**: Data should be loaded into a relational database, preferably PostgreSQL.

### Running the Queries

1.  Clone the repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/asenacak/Insurance_Analysis_SQL.git
    ```

2.  Load the dataset into your database.

3.  Execute the SQL scripts from the appropriate project directories to run the analysis.
